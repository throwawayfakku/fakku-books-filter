# Fakku Books Filter

This google chrome extension hides all fakku books / subscriptions from Fakku!

### To use, go to the link above and add it to Chrome.

### Note

This is a tiny side project for my personal Fakku experience. This is not intented for everyone, only those who wish to hide Fakku books / subscriptions. Feedback is welcome!

### Feature & Ideas that I might implement in the future(far future?):

- Allow users to partially minimize the fakku books content, possible to expand box
- Allow users to indicate tags which they do not want to see (eg. trap, monster-girl, futanari, etc)
